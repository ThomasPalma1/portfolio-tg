## **Introduction**

<p align="justify">Explain what this portfolio is about</p>

## **About me**

<p align="justify">Greetings! My name is Thomas Palma and I am 22 years old. I am a Systems Development Technician, graduated from Etec Machado de Assis, in Caçapava. I also have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Fatec Prof. Jessen Vidal, in São José dos Campos. I have a strong interest in Software Architecture and Development, Information Security and DevOps, and I am constantly improving my knowledge in technologies related to these areas.</p>


## **Academic Background**

 > **Systems Development Technician | ETEC Machado de Assis – Caçapava, São Paulo. Completion: 2019.**


 <p align="justify">During my technical course in Systems Development, I was able to improve my Hard Skills. I had contact with Java, PHP and Python. I also learned how to work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL and Arduino. At the end of the course, I developed a final Project as a team. The project consisted of developing a web system to facilitate the management of barbershops. In which it was possible to handle customers personal information, schedule appointments, make purchases and pay for services and products. As a special option, we added customer loyalty management.</p>


> **Systems Analysis and Development | FATEC Prof. Jessen Vidal – São José dos Campos, São Paulo. Completion: July 2023.**

<p align="justify">During my undergraduate studies in Systems Analysis and Development, I learned that it is necessary to be resilient, persistent and self-taught. Since the first semester, we have been developing <b>multidisciplinary projects</b> as a team. Five of them were with real companies in the job market. From these, we used agile methodologies, such as the Scrum methodology, for their implementation. A detailed description of each of these projects is below.</p>

> **International English Course | British Study Centres – London, England. Completion: January 2023 to February 2023.**

<p align="justify">Through a selection process based on grades and attendance carried out in 2022 by Centro Paula Souza, together with Fatec institutions (Sao Paulo State College of Technology), at the beginning of 2023 I had the opportunity to do a 4-week exchange with everything paid for in England, where I was able to study and live. It was a very enriching experience, where I learned many new things and met incredible people. During the exchange, I had English classes with experienced and highly qualified teachers, which allowed me to improve my vocabulary and understanding of the language. In addition, I participated in cultural activities, visiting museums, tourist attractions and historical sites, where I could better understand English and european culture and its magnificent history. I met students from different countries, such as: Kazakhstan, Japan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. This gave me the opportunity to make new friends and learn about their cultures and traditions.</p>

 ## **Professional Career**
 <p align="justify">I am a professional with two years of experience in the industrial administrative area.

For database, a relational database is used which is PostgreSQL. The company in question provides mobility and urban management solutions for city halls. ⚠️</p> 

## **My Main Knowledge**
As the semesters went by, I developed skills in the following technologies:

## **My Main Soft Skills**
* **Responsibility** 
   - Responsibility is a skill that is present in my daily life. Having the commitment to take on an activity and complete it within the agreed deadline is very important. Whenever I feel difficulty, I don't think twice before asking for help from someone with more knowledge than me, since delaying the activity can compromise the delivery.
* **Communication**
   - When we communicate cleanly and appropriately, everything leads to good results. During projects, I always tried to maintain good communication with all team members, always giving feedback on my progress and expressing my point of view in a constructive way for the quality of the project.
