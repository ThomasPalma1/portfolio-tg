## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">Develop an application that will improve the flow of requests. The goal of Alô Cidadão is to provide an easy-to-use application to receive requests for construction and maintenance, ensuring a more detailed and visual request. Our proposal is to allow citizens to make requests for construction or maintenance by inserting photos, descriptions, addresses or using the geolocation feature.</p>

## **About the Company**

<p align="justify">At the last minute, the company that would participate in this project ended up withdrawing. Since the college did not have a backup company to replace the one that had withdrawn and with a very tight schedule, in this fifth semester we did not carry out the project with an external company, but rather with an internal client, who was one of our professors. The proposed project was to develop a mobile application that allows citizens to catalog demands or complaints about construction and maintenance, facilitating a more detailed demand. Ongoing construction projects can be consulted to facilitate citizens movement around the city.</p>

## **Personal Contributions**

<p align="justify">This semester, I was part of the development team. On the server side, I was able to demonstrate my ability to create the application architecture, establishing business rules, developing services and structuring databases to store application data. MongoDB, a non-relational database, was chosen to store images of occurrences. For the rest of the application data, PostgreSQL was chosen. As a relational database, it is very efficient in handling the storage of information such as user data, requests, etc. Using Python with the <b>Flask Framework</b>, I developed the following services: user authentication, image sending and defining format standards for logs and their respective levels. Regarding the architecture, using Docker and <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, I deployed all the project services within virtual machines (on AWS), creating an entire ecosystem and enabling external access.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

O Alô Cidadão foi desenvolvido durante o **segundo semestre** de **2022**, no meu **quinto semestre** na Fatec. Tive a oportunidade de aprender e operar as seguintes tecnologias:

  1.  **Python** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  2.  **Flask** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  3.  **PostgreSQL** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  4.  **MongoDB** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  5.  **Docker** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  6.  **Amazon Web Services** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  7.  **JavaScript** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  8.  **React Native** &#8594; I can do it with help.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Futuristic |** I developed and adapted the applications back-end services with a view to deploying it on an AWS instance, so that it can be used from anywhere.

<br>

* **Realization |** Every day I found myself committed to developing the application specifications and, in parallel, configuring the deployment in the best way possible through AWS using Docker.
