## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">The mobile application <b>TecSoja</b> seeks to assist farmers in all demands involving technology for better soybean production, with a focus on analyzing and increasing productivity. The proposed solution is to create an application for mobile devices that enables farmers to estimate their productivity for each crop and total productivity. In addition, it allows farmers to compare productivity and planted areas in other municipalities around them. Through the application, farmers will also be able to have access to a comprehensive analysis of costs, climate and ideal harvest time, all based on the geolocation of their crop. In view of this, the application seeks to solidify records and information focused on the producer's crop and region.</p>

## **About the Company**

<p align="justify"><b>Visiona Space Technology</b>, a company located in the São José dos Campos technology park, focuses on the integration of space systems. Founded and established in 2012, its purpose is to meet the objectives of the <b>National Space Activities Program</b> and the <b>Strategic Space Systems Program</b>. The company was responsible for the <b>Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications Satellite Program</b>, the <b>SGDC</b>, launched in 2017. In 2018, Visiona announced the program for the first satellite designed entirely by the national industry, the <b>VCUB1</b>, and successfully completed the first Satellite Orbit and Attitude Control System developed in Brazil. Visiona also provides Remote Sensing and Satellite Telecommunications products and services, as well as SAR Aerial Survey in the X and P Bands.</p>

## **Personal Contributions**

<p align="justify">I was a member of the development team. In this project, I was responsible for developing and integrating the map view into the application using React Native. On the server side, I developed and implemented the architecture responsible for managing the plots. I also developed the business rule around user permission to share their location.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

TecSoja was developed during the **first semester** of **2022**, in my **fourth semester** at Fatec. I had the opportunity to learn and operate the following technologies:

  1.  **Node.js** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  2.  **PostgreSQL** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  3.  **JavaScript** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  4.  **React Native** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  5.  **Expo** &#8594; I can do it with help.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Adaptability |** The project topic was completely unknown to the team. Therefore, we were discovering the details of each functionality one day at a time, so that we would not be anxious about the real applicability of our software.

<br>

* **Relationship |** It was the first API developed after the return of in-person classes due to **Covid-19** and the **global pandemic**. Because of this, it was important to develop friendships among the members so that they could feel satisfied when helping each other during the implementation of the application.
