## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">The main objective of this project is to develop an online price comparison tool that uses data provided by Open Finance and presents this data in an intuitive and fluid way to the user. Based on the user's decisions, the artificial intelligence created will provide personalized recommendations for rates, banks and values.</p>

## **Sobre a Empresa**

<p align="justify">The company responsible for this project was JPMorgan Chase & Co, an internationally renowned bank. It is a global bank with extensive experience in the financial sector. Recognized for its competence and innovation, the bank offers society a wide range of financial services with transparency and security regarding customer data.</p>

## **Contribuições Pessoais**

<p align="justify">Throughout this project, I highlight my contributions in three main areas. I virtualized the services with Docker, created a Web Scraper and helped develop a recommendation artificial intelligence using the Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, implemented through the Scikit-learn library. I also helped structure the back-end of the project.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

MoneyMind was developed during the **first semester** of **2023**, in my **sixth** and **last semester** at Fatec. I had the opportunity to learn and operate the following technologies:

  2.  **Java** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  6.  **Spring Boot** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  3.  **MySQL** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  4.  **Python** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  7.  **TensorFlow** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  5.  **Scikit-learn** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  1.  **Docker** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  8.  **TypeScript** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  9.  **Vue** &#8594; I can do it with help.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Studious |** To implement the artificial intelligence and data scraping service, it was necessary to do a lot of research and learn about how this process was done, on both sides. Therefore, I constantly studied and implemented improvements to the project's source code.

<br>

* **Adaptability |** At the beginning of the project, the team was completely unfamiliar with the topic. So, as a team, we gradually explored all possible features to avoid any issues regarding the practical feasibility of the software.
