## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">In the first semester, we did not do the project with an external client, but with an internal client, who was one of our teachers. The proposed project was an E-Commerce for sales of teaching materials, which after the purchase was completed, would make these purchased materials available. The material made available, upon payment, had an emphasis on the Higher Education course in Systems Analysis and referred to the subjects of Discrete Mathematics, English, Portuguese, Programming Algorithms, Hardware Laboratory and Computer Architecture and Organization.</p>

## **Personal Contributions**

<p align="justify">In this project, I acted as a <b>Scrum Master</b>. I helped eliminate deadlocks in the team and ensured that all members followed agile development throughout the Sprints, delivering results within the established deadline. In addition, I contributed to the structuring of the <b>back-end</b>. On the server side, I was responsible for developing the system architecture, downloading and deleting files, registering content and authenticating users.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

Mr. Academy was developed during the **second semester** of **2020**, in my **first semester** at Fatec. I had the opportunity to learn and operate the following technologies:

  1.  **PHP** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  2.  **MySQL** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  3.  **JavaScript** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  4.  **HTML** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  5.  **CSS** &#8594; I know how to do it independently.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Time management |** During the project, as a **Scrum Master** for the first time, I needed to manage my time more efficiently. I also monitored the [**Burndown chart**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burndown_chart) to check if the delivery was under control, thus making it possible to make deliveries within the stipulated deadline.;

<br>

* **Organization and planning |** I applied the **Scrum** methodology in practice, with the objective of managing the implementation of each of the functionalities of the **Product Backlog** through management with the **Trello** platform. Therefore, each of the activities, along with their progress, became more perceptible to the development team.
