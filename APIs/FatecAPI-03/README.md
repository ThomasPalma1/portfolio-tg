## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">In the third semester, the partner company was <b>Ionic Health</b>. The objective of the project was to develop a platform that would manage contacts and sales with each client of a company. In this way, through the system it would be possible to organize, monitor and supervise the communication process with clients, in addition to managing pipelines.</p>

## **About the Company**

<p align="justify"><b>Ionic Health</b> is a company specializing in innovation and digital transformation for healthcare. Formerly known as NESS Technology, in 1991, the company was founded with a focus on innovation and transformation, aiming to deliver results quickly and safely. Just like the world and technology, over the years, the company has also undergone constant transformations. Around 2017, its three main operating verticals: healthcare, legal and security began to follow their own trajectories. After a spin-off in 2019, the company NESS Health was established, which enters the discussion of innovation and digital transformation in the field of diagnostic medicine, bringing with it the desire to contribute to improving healthcare and offering greater efficiency to the Digital Patient Journey.</p>

## **Personal Contributions**

<p align="justify">I was a member of the development team. On the server side, I demonstrated competence in developing the system architecture, establishing business rules, creating routes and building the database using PostgreSQL. Using Java with the <b>Spring Framework</b>, I developed user authentication, user hierarchy/access level and sending emails.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

Ion-X was developed during the **second semester** of **2021**, in my **third semester** at Fatec. I had the opportunity to learn and operate the following technologies:

  1.  **Java** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  2.  **Spring Boot** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  3.  **PostgreSQL** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  4.  **HTML** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  5.  **CSS** &#8594; I can do it with help.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Focus |** Activities that were part of the requirements were the ones I developed with greater focus, aiming for the best result and making the best choice to obtain greater use of code and less rework during the development of the sprints.

<br>

* **Studious |** To implement the project server, it was necessary to research and learn about Java and Spring Boot. Therefore, I constantly implemented improvements to the project's source code.
