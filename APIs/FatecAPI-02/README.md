## **About the Project**

<p align="justify">The problem faced by the partner company, <b>GSW</b>, was that there was no centralized platform for managing the company's projects internally. Therefore, my team proposed the development of a dashboard to enable extensive data analysis of each of the ongoing projects, as well as to guide and assist the responsible developers. This way, our project made it possible to visualize everything that was happening in the open projects within the company. Therefore, the dissemination of information became faster and more efficient.</p>

## **Sobre a Empresa**

<p align="justify">The company <b>GSW</b> specializes in the development and implementation of intelligent solutions in Information Technology, with an emphasis on business management, tax management, customer relationship management and foreign trade operations. With 25 years of experience in the field of technology and in global IT projects, with over 400 employees spread across 6 units, <b>GSW</b> provides a broad portfolio built through solid alliances with global solutions companies in the area of ​​Information Technology, such as Thomson Reuters, SAP, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and Salesforce. <b>GSW</b> has excellence in meeting all the needs of its customers, from software development, implementation of an integrated business management system and satellite systems, to the allocation of technical and functional professionals.</p>

## **Contribuições Pessoais**

<p align="justify">In this second project, I once again held the position of Scrum Master. As I had done in the first project, I helped the team eliminate obstacles and ensured that all project developers worked side by side with the principles of agile development. I also helped to set up the <b>backend</b>. On the server side, using NodeJS, I was able to develop the business rules for each service that was entrusted to me. I used the <b>Nodemailer</b> library to develop the service that executes the sending of e-mails, which aims to send e-mails to the contributors registered in the open projects. By establishing a connection between the Google Charts service and the project database, it was possible to generate graphs and metrics with the purpose of providing specific information about the projects.</p>

## **Hard Skills**

Pantion was developed during the **first semester** of **2021**, in my **second semester** at Fatec. I had the opportunity to learn and operate the following technologies:

  1.  **NodeJS** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  2.  **PostgreSQL** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  3.  **JavaScript** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  4.  **HTML** &#8594; I know how to do it independently;
  5.  **CSS** &#8594; I can do it with help;
  6.  **Google Charts** &#8594; I can do it with help.

## **Soft Skills**

* **Empathy |** During the project, as a Scrum Master for the second time, I had to solidify my empathy with the other members, understanding each person's situation and difficulties, both technically and emotionally. Consequently, I had to deal with situations that required individual analysis so that the team would not lose harmony and deliver within the stipulated deadline.

<br>

* **Harmony |** In addition to empathy, I needed to establish harmony among the developers, seeking consensus among all. It is very important that the team moves forward in agreement throughout the entire project trajectory. I tried to lead everyone towards reconciliation to find common ground and proceed with the implementation of the project.
